A productive loan spell with Wigan Athletic of the Championship saw him promoted to the Chelsea first team upon his return in 2019, after which he began to establish himself as a regular fixture at right-back and earn a long-term contract extension in January 2020.\r\n\r\nAfter representing England at various youth levels, James was called up to the full international side for the first time in October 2020, earning his first cap against Wales.",
